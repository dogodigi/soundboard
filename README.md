Soundboard for Live Performance
==========
A tool to allow playback of sound clips through a simple click-based interface.

To run:

1. Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org)
2. `clone` and `cd` into the repo
3. Run `npm install`
4. Make sure your sounds are encoded with a [supported codec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio#Supported_audio_codecs) and place them into the /public/sounds directory
5. Run `node app`
6. Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your [modern browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio#Supported_browsers).

To-do list:

* Per-clip volume control
* Looping
* Nicer UI
* Fix large files bug
* Make it easier to use for non-tech-folk
